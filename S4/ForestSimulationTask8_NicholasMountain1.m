% What I have done in this simulation, is added fire breaks. To make this
% happen, I simply added a variable called "fireBreak" and set it equal to
% 3. Then, I added a line of fire breaks up the middle of the grid
% horizontally and vertically. Since the simulation says nothing about how
% to deal with a grid square that is assigned 3, fire will not spread
% across the fire breaks, and trees will not grow there. I made fire breaks
% because in the example forest fire simulation, they used fire breaks as a
% way of keeping the fires from spreading. This simulation gives the option
% of testing how effective the fire breaks are at keeping more trees alive.
